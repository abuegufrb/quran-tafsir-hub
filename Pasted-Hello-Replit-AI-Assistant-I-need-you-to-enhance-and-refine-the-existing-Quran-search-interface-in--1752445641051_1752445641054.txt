Hello Replit AI Assistant,

I need you to enhance and refine the existing Quran search interface in this project (“QuranTafsirHub”). Your task is to transform the simple search box into a robust, accurate, user-friendly Quran search engine that meets the following detailed requirements:


---

1. Search Input Behavior and Accuracy

Implement a single search field that accepts:

Surah number (1–114)

Ayah number

Full or partial Arabic or English text from the Quran

Surah name in Arabic or English


As soon as the user starts typing, display an autocomplete dropdown with relevant suggestions:

Surah names matching the input

Ayah references when the user enters “2:” or “Al-Baqarah:” etc.

Quranic phrases or words appearing in the first 20 matches


Ensure the search logic handles diacritics and common spelling variations in Arabic, and is case-insensitive for English.


2. Query Processing and Result Ranking

On submission or selection from autocomplete, query your internal data structure (verses_db) in this order:

1. Exact Surah and Ayah reference


2. Full-text match in Ayah text


3. Full-text match in Ayah’s tafsir text


4. Partial keyword match anywhere in the text or tafsir



Return up to 25 results, sorted by:

1. Exact reference match


2. Number of keyword occurrences


3. Surah ascending (for equal scores)




3. Interface and Display

Keep the RTL Arabic layout and “Cairo” font.

Place the search box prominently at top, with a clean “search-container” card.

Under the search box, display results in responsive cards showing:

Surah name (Arabic + English), Ayah number

The Arabic verse text (with proper Uthmani script)

The tafsir paragraph (truncate at 200 characters with “…read more” link)


Highlight the search terms in both verse text and tafsir.

Include pagination controls (“Next” / “Previous”) if more results are available.


4. Performance and Accessibility

Ensure autocomplete queries respond within 100 ms.

Debounce input by 250 ms to reduce unnecessary queries.

Make all interactive elements keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA labels, appropriate roles).


5. Mobile Responsiveness

On screens under 600px, make the search box full width, and stack result elements vertically.

Ensure touch targets are at least 44 × 44 px.


6. Error Handling and User Feedback

If no results, display: “عفواً، لم نعثر على أي نتائج. حاول كلمات أو مرجع آخر.”

If input is invalid (e.g. “120:5”), show inline validation: “رقم السورة يجب أن يكون بين 1 و114.”

Please implement these enhancements precisely, update all relevant templates, JavaScript, and styles in templates/index.html, static/style.css, and any client-side scripts. Once you’ve completed the changes, confirm “Search interface fully enhanced and tested.” Thank you!
