Hello, I need your help to complete and enhance the QuranTafsirHub project.

Project Goal:

Build a complete Quran search interface starting with Surah Al-Fatiha, including both Quranic text and Tafsir (interpretation). The goal is to allow users to search easily by verse number, Surah name, or any keyword — and retrieve accurate results with matched verses and related Tafsir.

Step 1: Add Quran Data File

Create a new file named verses_db.json and insert the following content. This file will contain Surah Al-Fatiha, with each verse and its corresponding simple Tafsir in JSON format:

[
  {
    "surah": 1,
    "ayah": 1,
    "text": "بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ",
    "tafsir": "This verse opens the Surah by declaring the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate."
  },
  {
    "surah": 1,
    "ayah": 2,
    "text": "الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ",
    "tafsir": "All praise is for Allah, the Lord and Sustainer of all worlds and creatures."
  },
  {
    "surah": 1,
    "ayah": 3,
    "text": "الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ",
    "tafsir": "A repetition of Allah’s attributes of mercy — the most general and the most specific forms of mercy."
  },
  {
    "surah": 1,
    "ayah": 4,
    "text": "مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ",
    "tafsir": "He is the Sovereign of the Day of Judgment — the day of final accountability."
  },
  {
    "surah": 1,
    "ayah": 5,
    "text": "إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ",
    "tafsir": "We worship You alone, and seek help only from You — total submission and reliance."
  },
  {
    "surah": 1,
    "ayah": 6,
    "text": "اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ",
    "tafsir": "We ask You to guide us to the Straight Path — the path of righteousness."
  },
  {
    "surah": 1,
    "ayah": 7,
    "text": "صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ",
    "tafsir": "The path of those who received Your grace — not of those who earned anger, nor those who went astray."
  }
]

Step 2: Load the File in Python

Inside main.py, make sure to load this file using the following code:

import json

with open("verses_db.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    verses_db = json.load(f)

You will use verses_db to perform search operations across Surah and verse data.


---

Step 3: Search Function Behavior

Please ensure the search system:

Accepts input like “Al-Fatiha”, “1:5”, or any Arabic keyword.

Matches across:

Surah names

Verse numbers

Full or partial text matches in either the Quranic verse or its Tafsir.


Displays results ranked by relevance.


Each result should include:

Surah name and verse number

The Quran verse

Its Tafsir (interpretation)


Highlight the matched keywords in the results, and display them in clean cards or containers for a professional look.


---

Step 4: Final Notes

Make sure the search input supports Arabic text input.

The file should be loaded only once during server start.

The app should display a message like “No results found” when no match is found.


Let me know when it's done so I can test it and proceed to upload additional Surahs and Tafsir data.

Thank you!
